# Congo
**by Curtis Yungen**

Congo is a website I created to sell my extensive collection of self-help books. Check it out by visiting https://congobooksales.com.

**The Project**

Over the years I've collected upwards of 460 books, most of them self-help books. I've read many but not all of them. A good number have been partially read, and others haven't even been opened. Now the books serve only to impress visitors to my apartment as they sit piled on the floor collecting dust.

These books have helped me; now they can help you, and at a great discount!

**The Inspiration**

This website was born from a love of two things: reading and coding. These combined with a deep admiration and respect for Amazon fueled the creation of Congo.

Everything on this site was created from scratch including all graphics, logos, page headers, button icons, and scripts. The only things taken from Amazon were the book cover images (as cited) and genuine inspiration from their beautiful and high-quality website.

**The Namesake**
The Congo is the second largest rainforest in the world, spanning 1.5 million square miles of Central Africa. It is home to the Congo River as well as over 10,000 animal species. It has been referred to as the Heart of Darkness, though there is no correlation between that title and this innocent little online bookstore.

**The Books**
All books are pre-owned and their conditions vary widely. Some books may be brand new and unblemished; others may have dog-eared pages, highlights, or tear stains. Rest assured that no book on Congo has ever been read in the bathroom.

Every book is listed for less than the market rate. Shipping is always free. The actual book covers may vary from the cover shown on the website.

Books will be up for sale until August 1, 2019.

**The Technology**
Payments are handled by PayPal rather than directly by Congo. User data is private and all passwords are encrypted.
